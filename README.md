# React Multi-step Form

1. Initialized the project using "create-next-app" with TypeScript. Then I added Prettier and a setup for Eslint and TypeScript to ensure that proper formatting and coding style is maintained throughout the project. Also updated the Gitignore file to ignore files from .yarn.

2. Installed "react-hook-form", "zod", "tailwindcss", "framer-motion", "postcss" packages. Also did the Tailwind and PostCSS configurations.

3. Created the folder structure of the project, containing "api" for our mocked fetch request, "assets" for images and other resources, "components" for the React components, "typings" for the TypeScript interfaces/types, "ui" for UI components like Inputs, Selects, Buttons, etc., "utils" for reusing functions and "tests" for our upcoming tests.
