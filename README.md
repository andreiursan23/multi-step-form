# React Multi-step Form

1. Initialized the project using "create-next-app" with TypeScript. Then I added Prettier and a setup for Eslint and TypeScript to ensure that proper formatting and coding style is maintained throughout the project. Also updated the Gitignore file to ignore files from .yarn.

2. Installed "react-hook-form", "zod", "tailwindcss", "framer-motion", "postcss" packages. Also did the Tailwind and PostCSS configurations.

3. Created the folder structure of the project, containing "api" for our mocked fetch request, "components" for the React components, "typings" for the TypeScript interfaces/types, "ui" for UI components like Inputs, Selects, Buttons, etc., "utils" for reusing functions.

4. Styling for the entire project will be responsive and created with "mobile first" phylosophy as this ensures that a minimum amount of CSS will be written.

5. For the rest of the project I tried to write code that is self explanatory, and to document where it may be not very clear.

6. In a real application I would add end to end testing, using a framework like Cypress, to test the main functionalities of the application. In our case because the application is small, it was manually tested.
